"Hasami-Shogi" is a familiar board game in Japan.
"Shogi" game itself requires deep-thinking more over Chess,
on the other hand, "Hasami-Shogi" is playing
among children using Shogi pieces and board.
("Hasami" is a form of Japanese verb "Hasamu"
that means "sandwich" used as like as
who sandwiches anything between two something.)

This app is not a robot but for match with your friends.
If there are two devices,
you can match through wireless(Bluetooth or IP).
You can select board and pieces from "Shogi" and "Chess".
Games\'s objective is to capture opponent\'s pieces
until gameover count.
Pieces are captured when you sandwiched opponent\'s piece

               W
               B
Or hold opponent\'s pieces at corner or border.

 +-------     +--------
 |WB          |   BWWB
 |B           |    BB
Multiple pieces will be captured at once.
Suicidal move(move your piece into between opponent's pieces
filling the intermediate space)
