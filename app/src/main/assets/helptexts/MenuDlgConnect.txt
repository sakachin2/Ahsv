** Connection Type **
"Local" : two players matches on a terminal.
"Bluetooth" : Connect two devices using bluetooth.
"IP" : Connect two devices thru Wi-Fi Access Point such as wireless rooter.
  Specify IP-address to connect.
"WiFi Direct" : Wi-Fi Direct(Peer to Peer) IP connection.
  Wi-Fi access point is not required.

!!! NFC is not supported from Android-10.

"NFC-Bluetooth" : For the device equipped NFC tag,
  establish Bluetooth connection
"NFC-WD" : For the device equipped NFC tag,
  establish Wi-Fi Direct connection
----------------
It seems to me that Bluetooth is easy to use. If it is troublesome, try Wifi Direct.
To change connection type among (NFC)Bluetooth, IP and (NFC)WiFi Direct and to change device to connect,
disconnect once current session.
"Discover"ing neighbor process takes some time at first in both case.

This App supports only legacy mode Bluetooth.
Device supporting only BLE(Low Enagy) mode is not available, try "Wifi Direct".
Radio-frequency interference may occur if the device has telephone function.
If the device is dual-band(2.4GHz and 5GHz), assign 5GHz to telephone.
Bluetooth uses 2.4GHz.
IP may cause transmission delay by base protocol.
(Detecting connection failure may take considarable time).

From Android6.0(MarchMallow), you may be asked to give permission to use Wifi Direct.
